    <h1>It was a Drive-By Fruiting!</h1>
    <section>
      <p>One of those days at work, lots of meetings, some "drive-by" conversations. Not really satisfying, but tiring. I miss the opportunity to do real thinking, planning. I feel like I'm just reacting to events around me and not able to focus. Hope this writing helps with that.</p>
