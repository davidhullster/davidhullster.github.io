<p>Jordan Peterson talks about the prevalence of dominance hierarchies in human societies, and how you can find meaning by finding the niche where your personality and skills are more valued. Finding meaning in life it a good way to stave off depression and self-doubt, both in my experience and according to clinical psychology studies.</p>

<p>For me it took years to come to the realization that the career I was in had lost it's value to the company I worked for. The company had changed, and I hadn't adapted, at least not in a way that the company valued. Oddly, the work I was doing was still useful, just not valued because of my job title.</p>

<p>Jordan says women select men based on their position in hierarchies, and I wonder if the fact that my manager was female gave extra weight to my position at the bottom of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Leaving the safety I thought I had at my old company took a lot of effort on my part, I spent nights and weekends updating my skills and passing certification exams. Initially I thought I could stay at the company in a different role, but I quickly discovered I would perfer leaving the company.</p>
