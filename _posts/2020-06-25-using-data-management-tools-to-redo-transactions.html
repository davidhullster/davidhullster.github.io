<ul>
<li>Microservices need a way to synchronize their data and roll back state, where possible.</li>
<li>AWS Step functions allow implementation of a Saga Execution Coordinator
<ul>
<li>Builds a centralized store of critical reference data </li>
<li>curated by master data management tools and procedures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using Lambda and scheduled Amazon CloudWatch events you can build a simple cleanup and deduplication mechanism</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Event Sourcing is useful where state changes affect multiple microservices
<ul>
<li>Persists every application change as an event record</li>
<li>Doesn't record application state</li>
<li>Data is stored as a stream of events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State can be determined and reconstructed at any point in time</li>
<li>Produces a persistent audit trail</li>
<li>Assists in debugging</li>
</ul>
