<p>Interesting that Amazon now sells short books, some under a hundred pages.<br> I wonder if that's a good thing? Is there something special about the 300 to 500 page book form that we're losing. <br>Has Twitter and instant messaging caused us to lose a valuable ability to sit still for long periods. <br>How does this affect my team's ability to write long-form test plans, and understand lengthy design documents. <br>Is this the end of the world? :)</p>
