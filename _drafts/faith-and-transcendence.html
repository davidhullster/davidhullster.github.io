<p>My wife's from a strong Christian background, her older brother was a pastor in the country where she grew up, and converted the entire family to Christianity when my wife was a teenager. </p>

<p>My parents brought us up to distrust religion, my mom felt that she got no help from God or anybody else raising herself and her sister. Her father left the family at an early age, and the mom struggled to raise her two elementary school age daughters alone. My mom sadly describes the 3 or 4 men who temporarily replaced her father, and her mom's increasing retreat into drinking. A near-sexual incident with one of these men, and a sexual assault when she was walking home from work  after she'd graduated high school marked her, and shake her emotionally now 60 years later. She is sometimes harshly judgmental, and understandably slow to trust anyone, and that spirit infected me and both my brothers.</p>

<p>My wife and I met in our 30's, she was living with her sister's family here in town, and I was living in a rented room near the university. I applied to a local adult literacy agency where my wife-to-be worked, she was organizing volunteers like me to teach adults to read. I think we were both lonely and looking for someone to date. My wife was also on an expired tourist visa, which may have lowered her dating standards a bit. </p>
