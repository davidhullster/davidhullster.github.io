<p>Miserable can mean physical poverty, to the point of hunger and despair.</p>


<p>It can also mean emotional unhappiness totally unrelated to your physical state.  Misery implies a sort of unending state, or at least not something that passes away in a few minutes. Otherwise it wouldn't be misery, right? A pinprick can be painful, but it doesn't cause misery. A lifetime of pinpricks, there's misery...</p>


<p>I guess I'm in a dark mood today</p>
