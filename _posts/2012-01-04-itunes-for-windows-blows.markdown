<p>Spent a couple hours trying to update my wife's 3gs, couldn't get one playlist to synch to the phone. <br>Was a new Michael Buble album, not new to the world, 2007, I think, but new to her. <br>Make up for a lack of Christmas presents. <br>Hah, she won't even notice there's two of his albums instead of just one.</p>
