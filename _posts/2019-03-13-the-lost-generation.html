<p>I have a BA in French Literature, and spent a couple years in grad school working on a Master's degree in that subject. <br>I loved interpretation of lit, finding hidden meaning in french films from the 50's, making wild parallels between medieval folk tales and modern books and stories.</p>


<p>I now have a bunch of software engineering certs and spend nearly all my free time studying to keep up with the latest development tools. <br>It's safer, in a way, no one gets offended by my opinion on how software should work. <br>Sadly, I've lost my connection to a lot of art, music and literature in the process. <br>Those used to be nearly all I cared about.</p>


<p>I'm hoping my daughter will be able to stick with her passion for music and art, she has some interest in reading, but she hasn't had much exposure to literature. <br>My wife discovered late in life a love for dance, and through that latin music. <br>I'm sad that I wasn't able to pass on an appreciation of literature to my daughter. <br>I guess it's possible she'll discover it on her own given her love of the arts.</p>


<p>I've heard that classical literature isn't taught in the schools anymore, and I can understand how it's hard for young people to see the value of reading, when you can find video on almost any conceivable subject. <br> Maybe video education will replace reading, I'd like to see a way to make it less passive. <br>I've always thought that writing was important to organizing my thoughts, I don't see a technological replacement for that.</p>
