<strong>Service Meshes</strong>


<ul>
<li>microservice applications can be made up of <strong>thousands</strong> of services</li>
<li>most <strong>complex</strong> part is often <strong>communication</strong> between services</li>
<li>service meshes are a <strong>layer</strong> for handling inter-service communication</li>
<li>service meshes handle <strong>monitoring</strong> and <strong>controlling</strong> traffic</li>
<li>tasks like Service Discovery can be <strong>fully</strong> handled in the service mesh layer</li>
</ul>
