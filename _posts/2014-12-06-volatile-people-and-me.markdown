See the opposition there, in my title? I may be volatile, too, a little emotional, but the emotions don't show like some other folks. That's why I fit in with engineers, I think.
I have a theory that engineers often suppress their emotions because they need to focus on their work. I mean, getting distracted by your annoyance with your boss, or your anger at your noisy neighbor gets in the way of keeping a complex coding problem structured in your head.
I'm more of a technician than an engineer, I like to fix things and solve problems. Engineers solve problems too, but I think on a larger scale than what I normally work on.
