<pre><code># troubleshoot error: UPGRADE FAILED: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress (the release that was in progress didn't show when I ran helm ls -n &lt;namespace&gt;)

helm delete &lt;release that's in progress&gt; -n &lt;namespace&gt;

example:
&gt;&gt;helm delete inventory-api-development -n development
release "inventory-api-development" uninstalled</code></pre>
