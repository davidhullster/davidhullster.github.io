<p>Got yet another phone interview scheduled, it's a lousy way to find new employees, so hard to communicate. <br>I feel sorry for the candidate, half the time we bring them in and find out they're totally different in person. <br>Makes me wonder if the ones we reject in phone interviews might really be okay. <br>We'll never know, I guess.</p>
