<p>Nobody should expect to be paid for their passion, but your greatest satisfaction, your greatest benefit to your community is where you can actually contribute at your highest level. </p>

<p>Imagine that someone off the street came into your work and could do twice the work at higher quality than you in the same amount of time</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now imagine that you could do the same, with some training, in another field. </p>

<p>Wouldn't everyone benefit if the person off the street did your job, and you did whatever you were better at?</p>

<p>If your kid shows promise at fixing things, don't push him to become a lawyer, if she likes winning arguments, don't tell her she's a failure if she doesn't get an A in algebra.</p>
