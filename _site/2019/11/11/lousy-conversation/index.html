    <h1>Lousy Conversation</h1>
    <section>
      <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm a terrible conversationalist, I lose track of my train of thought in the middle of talking, especially when I start to feel passionate about a subject, and have to stop to gather my thoughts. If I ever recover where I was going, the conversation has moved on. To paraphrase, the great Jon Lovitz, "See, how it works is, theÂ <em>train moves</em>, not the station". (okay, the quote doesn't work here, but it's funny anyway)</p>
