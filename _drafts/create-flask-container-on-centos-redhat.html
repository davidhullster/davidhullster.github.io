<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">
Launch a container with the CentOS image.

lxc launch images:centos/7/amd64 Backend

Enter the container.
lxc exec Backend bash

Configure the Container
Create a backend user (-m creates home directory)
useradd backend -m

Create a password for the newly created user.
passwd backend

Install git and vim.
yum install git vim

Switch to the backend user.
su backend

Change directories.
cd /home/backend/

Get the project from GitHub.
git clone https://github.com/ErminLA/Containers.git

Copy a couple of files from the repository to the current directory.
cp /home/backend/Containers/app.py .
cp /home/backend/Containers/our-app.service .

Remove the Containers directory.
rm -rf /home/backend/Containers

Log out as the backend user.
exit

Install some prerequisites.
yum install python36 python36-devel -y

Log back in as backend.
su backend

Install some more prerequisites.
pip3 install --user flask flask_cors mysql-connector waitress

Log out of the backend user.
exit

Log out of the container.
exit

Display container information. Copy the IPV4 address for the database. This will be referred to as &lt;DATABASE_IP&gt; through the rest of this lab.
lxc list

Connect to the container.
lxc exec Backend bash

Log back in as backend.
su backend

Edit the app.py file.
vim /home/backend/app.py

Find the section in the file for \@app.route("/motd") and change the line defining mariadb_connection:
Change user='chronic' to user='cloud_user'
Change host='10.95.211.29' to host='&lt;DATABASE_IP&gt;'

Find the section in the file for \@app.route("/set_motd") and change the line defining mariadb_connection:
Change user='chronic' to user='cloud_user'
Change host='10.95.211.29' to host='&lt;DATABASE_IP&gt;'
Save the changes and exit the editor.

On the Container, Daemonize the Process
Make a directory.
mkdir /home/backend/our-backend

Log out of backend.
exit

Copy the our-app.service file.
cp /home/backend/our-app.service /etc/systemd/system/

Verify the contents of the file.
vim /etc/systemd/system/our-app.service

Exit the editor without making any changes.

Move the app.py file.
mv /home/backend/app.py /home/backend/our-backend/app.py

Change the permissions on the file. Note that this is done later in the video but is put here to avoid errors that occur in the lab.
chmod 500 /home/backend/our-backend/app.py

Reload daemons.
systemctl daemon-reload

Start the our-app service.

systemctl start our-app
Enable our-app.

systemctl enable our-app
Verify that the service is working.

systemctl status our-app
On the Container, Install and Configure Apache Web Server for a Virtual Host to Accept Connections on Port 80
Install httpd.

yum install httpd
Start and enable the httpd service.

systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
Verify the service is running.

systemctl status httpd
Create some necessary directories.

mkdir /etc/httpd/sites-enabled
mkdir /etc/httpd/sites-available
Create a configuration file.

vim /etc/httpd/sites-available/our-name.com.conf
Paste the following into the file.

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
ProxyPass          /    http://127.0.0.1:8080/
ProxyPassReverse   /    http://127.0.0.1:8080/

&lt;Proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080/&gt;
        Require all granted
        Options None
&lt;/Proxy&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
Save the changes and exit the editor.

Edit the httpd service configuration file.

vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Find the line that says Listen 80 and edit it to the following.

Listen 0.0.0.0:80
Add the following to the end of the file.

IncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.conf
Save the changes and exit the editor.

Create a link for the our-name.com.conf file.

ln -s /etc/httpd/sites-available/our-name.com.conf /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/our-name.com.conf
Create a Redirect on the Host
Exit the container.

exit
List the containers.

lxc list
Create the redirect. Make sure to replace &lt;BACKEND_IP&gt; with the IP displayed in response to the previous command.

lxc config device add Backend myport80 proxy listen=tcp:0.0.0.0:80 connect=tcp:&lt;BACKEND_IP&gt;:80
Verify the Back End is Accessible with curl from a Playground Instance
Open a playground instance.

Install curl if it is not already installed.

sudo yum install curl
Attempt to connect to the back end. Make sure to substitute the &lt;PUBLIC_IP&gt; of the test server. These should return responses if everything is working correctly.

curl http://&lt;PUBLIC_IP&gt;/
curl http://&lt;PUBLIC_IP&gt;/random_number
curl http://&lt;PUBLIC_IP&gt;/youtube_video
