### PASSWORD CRACKERS

#### Although there are some Windows tools, including the infamous Cain and L0phtcrack (l0phtcrack.com) tools, most password crackers run primarily on Linux.
Additionally, John the Ripper is an open source tool used for fast password cracking. Its primary focus is UNIX-based operating systems, but also Windows LanMan (LM) hashes. For example, a tool such as Hashcat (hashcat.net/hashcat) is run using the following general syntax:
```sh
hashcat -m HashType -a AttackMode -o OutputFile InputHashFile
```

The input file should contain hashes of the same type, using the specified format (hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes). Hashcat can be used with a single word list (dictionary mode -a 0) or multiple word lists (combinator mode -a 1). Mode -a 3 performs a brute-force attack, but this can be combined with a mask for each character position. This reduces the key space that must be searched and speeds up the attack. For example, you might learn or intuit that a company uses only letter characters in passwords. By omitting numeric and symbol characters, you can speed up the attack on each hash.


Running a masked brute-force attackâ€”this example is running on a VM, so the recovery rate is very low. (Screenshot hashcat hashcat.net/hashcat.)
