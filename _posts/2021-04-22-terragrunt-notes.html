<p>you can define your backend configuration just once in the root terragrunt.hcl file</p>
    <p># stage/terragrunt.hcl</p>
<pre>remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  }
  config = {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"

    key = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The <b>generate</b> attribute is used to inform Terragrunt to generate the <br>
    Terraform code for configuring the backend. <br>
    When you run any Terragrunt command, Terragrunt <br>
    will generate a <i>backend.tf</i> file with the contents <br>
    set to the terraform block that configures the s3 backend, <br>
    just like what we had before in each <i>main.tf</i> file.<br>
    The final step is to update each of the child terragrunt.hcl <br>
    files to tell them to include the configuration<br>
    from the root terragrunt.hcl:
    
    # stage/mysql/terragrunt.hcl
</p>
<pre>
    include {
      path = find_in_parent_folders()
    }
</pre>
