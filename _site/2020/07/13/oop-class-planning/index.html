    <h1>OOP Class Planning</h1>

<p>Before you decide to define a new class, there are a few things to keep in mind, and questions you should ask yourself:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Figure out your data</strong>: (Data about songs from iTunes? Data about tweets? Data about hashtag searches on Twitter? Two numbers that represent coordinates of a point on a 2-dimensional plane?)</li>
<li><strong>What your class instances represent determines what you name the class</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In other words, which sort of new <strong>thing</strong> in your program should have <strong>fancy</strong> functionality? One song? One hashtag? One tweet? One point? </li>
<li>The answer to this question should help you decide what to <strong>call</strong> the class you define.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What information should each instance have as instance variables?</strong> This is related to what an instance represents. See if you can make it into a sentence. 
<ul>
<li><em>“Each instance represents one <strong>song</strong> and each <strong>song</strong> has an <strong>artist</strong> and a <strong>title</strong> as instance variables.”</em> </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Or, <em>“Each instance represents a <strong>Tweet</strong> and each <strong>Tweet</strong> has a <strong>User</strong> and a <strong>content string</strong> as instance variables.”</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What instance methods should each instance have?</strong> What should each instance be able to <em>do</em>?
<ul>
<li>Does each song has a method that uses a lyrics API to get a long string of its lyrics</li>
<li>Does each song has a method that returns a string of its artist’s name?</li>
<li>Or for a tweet, does each tweet has a method that returns the length of the tweet’s message?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What should the printed version of an instance look like?</strong> (This question will help you decide how to write the <code>__str__</code> method.)
<ul>
<li>“Each song printed out will show the song title and the artist’s name.” </li>
<li>Or “Each Tweet printed out will show the username of the person who posted it and the message content of the tweet.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After considering those questions and making decisions about how you’re going to get started with a class definition, you can begin to define your class.</p>
